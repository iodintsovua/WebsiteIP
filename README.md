WebsiteIP
=========

A chrome extension which shows the IP of the website you are viewing at the bottom right corner.

It is intended for developers and techicians.  
It's simple, but it solves your problems and saves your ass.


TODOs
--------

This fork plans to clean up the code and add some features
(strikethroughs are done).

* ~~Copy IP to clipboard --- raised by the original author [Craig Thomas](https://github.com/tinybigideas).
  I am thinking of binding it to a shortcut key.~~
* Things that ought to be configurable:
  - *all_frames* : show IP on all frames or only the top frame?
  - *run_at* : `document_start` or `document_end`?
  - *the div* : show on the left or the right by default? with exceptions?
* ~~Remove the popup. Just use different icons.~~
* ~~Not sure if this is doable, but I want the IP still showed if I press 'Esc'
  when the page is loading (TCP reset).~~
